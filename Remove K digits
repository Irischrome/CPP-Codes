I am going to just write the function which takes a string as input(the number) and k digits to be removed such that the number
is the smallest. When I first solved this problem, I thought the numbers must be consecutive which meade me find out that if you 
compare integers as string, it still gives the correct result and obviously using strings you can compare much larger numbers than
can be stored in int or long.

string removeKDigits(string num, int k){
  if(num.length()==k)
    return "0";
  }
  
  for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
    int j=0;
    while(j<num.length-1 && num[j]<=num[j+1]){
      j++;
    }
    num.erase(j,1);
  }
  
  while(num.length()>1 && num[0]=='0'){
    num.erase(0,1);
  }
  return num;
}
